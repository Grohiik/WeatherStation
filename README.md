# Weather Station - System Development

This is a project that includes three different tech stacks. The embedded system, the web app and the server. The embedded system consists of sensor suite for collecting different types of data from the environment, such as temperature and send it to the server for storage and for later analysis. The web app can fetch the data from the server and display it.

# Development

Every project is split into its down directory and have their own `README` on how to get the tools needed. Be sure to also read through the [Docs/README.md](/Docs/README.md) in the [Docs](/Docs) directory before you start developing.
